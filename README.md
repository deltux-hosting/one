# Deltux ONE
Deltux ONE is software made by Deltux to simplify the management of game servers and Discord bots. It connects Pterodactyl via its API to our self-written ecommerce system to combine all functions into one dashboard. On top of that, our software adds new features in addition to the already existing Pterodactyl features.

Our software is built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS while the Pterodactyl backend is mainly built using PHP and Go.

## How to contribute?
Deltux ONE is **still being developed**, the expected release date is January 1, 2023. Currently, the software is not open source (yet), but this GitHub page can be used for **sharing ideas** in the Discussions section.

Deltux will actively fix bugs and work on ideas, thus keeping Deltux ONE above the competition. We would like to thank the creators of Pterodactyl, as it is an excellent foundation for this project.
